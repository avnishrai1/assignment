    "Ans.A database is a structured collection of data that is organized and stored in a way that allows efficient retrieval, manipulation, \n",
    "    and management of that data. Databases are used to store and manage large volumes of information for various applications and purposes.\n",
    "    They provide mechanisms for storing, organizing, querying, updating, and deleting data, ensuring data integrity, security, and scalability.\n",

    "    structure of database objects, such as tables, indexes, views, and schemas. DDL statements are responsible for creating, altering, and \n",

    "    DQL is focused on querying and retrieving information stored within database tables. The primary DQL statement is the SELECT statement, \n",

    "  4.WHERE: The WHERE clause is used to filter rows based on specified conditions. It is applied after the data is retrieved from the tables \n",
