    "Q1. What is an exception in python? Write the difference between syntax and exceptions errors .\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans. In Python, an exception is an event that occurs during the execution of a program that disrupts the normal flow of the \n",
    "     program. When an exceptional situation or error occurs, an exception object is created and raised, which can be caught and \n",
    "     handled by appropriate code.\n",

    "     Difference between syntax and exception errors:\n",
    "     \n",
    "     Syntax Error:\n",
    "   1.Syntax errors occur when the code violates the rules of the Python language grammar.\n",
    "   2.These errors are usually detected by the Python interpreter during the parsing phase before the program execution.\n",
    "   3.Examples of syntax errors include missing colons, incorrect indentation, mismatched parentheses, or using undefined variables.\n",
    "   \n",
    "     Exception Error:\n",
    "   1.Exception errors occur during the execution of a program and are caused by exceptional situations or errors.\n",
    "   2.These errors can arise due to various reasons such as invalid input, file I/O errors, arithmetic errors (like division by \n",
    "     zero), or accessing an undefined object.\n",
    "   3.Exception errors can be handled using try-except statements to catch and handle specific types of exceptions or using a \n",
    "     generic except block to catch any exception.\n",
    "   4.Examples of exception errors include ValueError, TypeError, ZeroDivisionError, FileNotFoundError, etc.\n",

    "    conditions or situations that are not covered by the built-in exceptions provided by Python. They allow programmers to define \n",
    "    their own exception classes and raise those exceptions when necessary in their code.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Custom exceptions are needed to:\n",
    "\n",
    "  1)Provide specific and meaningful error messages: By creating custom exceptions, programmers can provide more detailed and \n",
    "    specific error messages that accurately describe the exceptional condition or error that occurred. This helps in troubleshooting \n",
    "    and debugging code more effectively.\n",
    "  2)Handle application-specific errors: Custom exceptions allow programmers to handle errors or exceptional situations that are \n",
    "    specific to their application or domain. They can define exception classes that encapsulate the logic and behavior required \n",
    "    to handle those specific errors.\n",
    "  3)Enhance code readability and maintainability: Custom exceptions can make code more readable and self-explanatory. By using \n",
    "    well-named exception classes, it becomes easier for other developers to understand the purpose of the exception and how to \n",
