    "Ans.An API (Application Programming Interface) is a set of protocols, rules, and tools that allow different software applications to \n",
    "    communicate and interact with each other. APIs define how software components should interact, enabling developers to build applications\n",
    "    that can leverage the functionality of other services, libraries, or platforms without needing to understand their internal workings.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Example: One common real-life example of an API is in the context of weather information. Suppose you're building a weather \n",
    "    forecasting application, but you don't have the resources to collect and maintain weather data yourself. Instead, you can use a weather \n",
    "    data provider's API to retrieve weather information for various locations. The weather data provider's API would expose endpoints that \n",
    "    allow you to make requests for current weather conditions, forecasts, and other related data. By integrating this API into your \n",
    "    application, you can display accurate weather information to your users without having to handle the data collection and processing \n",
    "    yourself.\n",

    "Ans.Advantages of Using APIs:\n",
    "\n",
    "  1.Code Reusability: APIs allow developers to reuse existing functionality without having to reinvent the wheel. This speeds up \n",
    "    development and reduces the chances of errors.\n",
    "  2.Time Savings: By using APIs, developers can save time on building complex features from scratch, leading to faster development cycles.\n",
    "  3.Scalability: APIs can help distribute the load across different services, allowing applications to scale more effectively to handle \n",
    "    increased user demand.\n",
    "  4.Innovation: APIs allow third-party developers to build upon existing platforms, fostering innovation and expanding the capabilities of \n",
    "    existing services.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Disadvantages of Using APIs:\n",
    "    \n",
    "  1.Security Risks: Poorly designed or insecure APIs can expose vulnerabilities that can be exploited by attackers.\n",
    "  2.Data Privacy Concerns: APIs often involve data sharing, and improper handling of data through APIs can lead to privacy breaches or \n",
    "    data leaks.\n",
    "  3.Complexity: Integrating multiple APIs and managing their interactions can become complex, leading to challenges in debugging and \n",
    "    troubleshooting.\n",
    "  4.Dependency: When an application relies heavily on external APIs, any changes or downtime in those APIs can affect the functionality \n",
    "    of the application.\n",

    "Q4. Explain REST and SOAP Architecture. Mention shortcomings of SOAP.\n",
