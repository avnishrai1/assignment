    "Q1. Which function is used to open a file? What are the different modes of opening a file? Explain each mode of file opening.\n",

    "     \"r\": Read mode. Opens the file for reading. The file must exist; otherwise, an error is raised.\n",
    "\n",

    "    created.\n",

    "2. \"a\": Append mode. Opens the file for appending new content at the end. If the file doesn't exist, a new file is created.\n",

    "5. \"t\": Text mode. Used in conjunction with other modes to open the file in text format. This is the default mode if not specified.\n",
