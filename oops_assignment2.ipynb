    "Q5. Can we create an instance of an abstract class? Explain your answer.\n",
    "Ans. No, we cannot create an instance of an abstract class in Python. An abstract class is a class that is meant to be used only as a base class for \n",
    "     other classes. It cannot be instantiated directly because it is incomplete and lacks the implementation of one or more abstract methods.\n",
    "     \n",
    "     An abstract method is a method declared in the abstract class but without any implementation. It serves as a placeholder for methods that must be \n",
    "     implemented by the subclasses that inherit from the abstract class.\n",
    "     \n",
    "     To create an object or instance of a class, the class must be concrete, meaning it provides the complete implementation of all methods, including \n",
    "     any abstract methods inherited from abstract base classes.\n",
    "     \n",
    "     Attempting to instantiate an abstract class directly will result in a TypeError with a message indicating that the abstract class cannot be \n",
    "     instantiated. Abstract classes are designed to be inherited from, allowing subclasses to provide the implementation for abstract methods and create \n",
    "     instances of those subclasses. This way, the abstract class acts as a blueprint or contract, defining the common interface and behavior that the \n",
    "     subclasses should adhere to.\n",
